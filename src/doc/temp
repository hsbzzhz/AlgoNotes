is about how I build the IOT dataflow,

the dataflow is that , cal features and raw features
when I tried get cal features I found cal data wasn't sync from the raw data, or there is a delay for cal data, at least 2min delay
in some cases, the pump status showed off, but some cal features under this pump are still running.

the reason is that using cron job to calculate some features in each 1min for the old dataflow architecture.
the cal features were always later than the raw features, and when the system query data from db, 
so I identify the root cause is the fixed running time for cron job,

I seeking some real-time data processing solutions (read some relevant article and did some demos), and I shared these solutions during sprint meeting and discuss with other colleagues,
and under their help, I choose Flink and redis to redesign our dataflow architure finally.

solve the problem, all status and cal are sync, and boost the efficiency
